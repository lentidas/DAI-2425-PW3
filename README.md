## Usage



The full API specification is available in [this document](./docs/api_doc.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> For compatibility through multiple operating systems, we recommend you run this program using Docker. You can still run the JAR we release, but ensure you have Java 21 or later installed on your machine.

### Build Docker image

The image to run the program is available alongside the releases of this repository:

```shell
# Pull the image from GitHub Container Registry.
docker pull ghcr.io/lentidas/dai-2425-pw3:latest
```

You can also build the image yourself using the provided Dockerfile:

```shell
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/lentidas/DAI-2425-PW3.git

# Change to the project directory.
cd DAI-2425-PW3

# Build the Docker image.
docker build -t quickgpg:latest .
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the following sections, adapt the commands to use the image you built or pulled from the GitHub Container Registry.

### Print the help message

To print the help message, you can use the following commands:

```shell
# Print the help message for the server.
docker run ghcr.io/lentidas/dai-2425-pw3:latest server --help

# Starting the container without arguments defaults to printing the help message for the server.
docker run ghcr.io/lentidas/dai-2425-pw3:latest
```

### Start the HTTP server

To start the server, you can use the following commands:

> [!NOTE]
> The `Dockerfile` exposes the port `7070` by default. As you noted from the examples above, if you want to change the port of the program using the `-p` or `-b` flags, you must also expose the same port when running the container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since we are using Docker, the server will not be accessible with the default listening address of `127.0.0.1`. You must ALWAYS override and use a *any* address like `0.0.0.0` or `::` to allow connections from outside the container.

### Start the PostgresSQL database

To start the client, you can use the following commands:

> [!NOTE]
> The `Dockerfile` exposes the port `5432` by default. As you noted from the examples above, if you want to change the port of the program using the `-p` or `-b` flags, you must also expose the same port when running the container.

### Using the JAR

Using the JAR directly is also possible, as long as you have a database deployed on a locally-running PostgresSQL database. Default connection parameters are as follows:

- Database: `gpg_keyserver_db`
- Schema: `gpg_keyserver`
- Username: `gpg_keyserver`
- Password: `gpg_keyserver`
- Port: 5432

You can download the JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/lentidas/DAI-2425-PW3/releases).

### Clone and build the project

We use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to manage our project. The Maven wrapper is versioned alongside with the rest of the code, as well as some project configurations for [IntelliJ IDEA from Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). These project files contain run configurations that you can use to run the program from the IDE.

To clone and build the project on the command line, you can use the following commands:

```shell
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/lentidas/DAI-2425-PW3.git

# Change to the project directory.
cd DAI-2425-PW3

# Modify the code as you wish.

# Check that the code is well formatted...
./mvnw spotless:check

# ...and eventually format it.
./mvnw spotless:apply

# Build the project with the dependencies.
./mvnw dependency:go-offline clean compile package

# Run the program (do not forget to adjust the version accordingly).
java -jar target/quickgpg-1.0.0.jar --help
```
